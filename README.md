# TOP-LandingPage

TOP Landing Page Project. Used new skills in html & CSS to work on this. 

Notes for next time:
    -plan more
        -Just wrote it up as I saw it instead of thinking about what classes were similiar
        or css that could be reused.
    -use consistent spacing values
        -I had trouble getting the first two rows of the website to line up. Looking at other solutions
        I could have used margins more instead of eyeballing with the flex gap property. Makes shrinking
        the website harder. Max-width is what I need to make more use of too.
